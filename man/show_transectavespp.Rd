\usage{
show_transectavespp(
  transectocc,
  bay_segment = c("OTB", "HB", "MTB", "LTB", "BCB"),
  yrrng = c(1998, 2022),

}
\arguments{
\item{transectocc}{data frame returned by \code{\link{anlz_transectocc}}}

\item{bay_segment}{chr string for the bay segment, one to many of "OTB", "HB", "MTB", "LTB", "BCB"}

\item{yrrng}{numeric indicating year ranges to evaluate}

\item{species}{chr string of species to summarize, one to many of "Halodule", "Syringodium", "Thalassia", "Ruppia", "Halophila", "Caulerpa"}

\item{total}{logical indicating if total frequency occurrence for all species is also returned, only applies if \code{asreact = FALSE}}

\item{alph}{numeric indicating alpha value for score category colors}

\item{family}{optional chr string indicating font family for text labels}

\item{plotly}{logical if matrix is created using plotly}

\item{asreact}{logical if a reactable table is returned instead of a plot}

\item{width}{numeric for width of the plot in pixels, only applies of \code{plotly = TRUE}}

\item{height}{numeric for height of the plot in pixels, only applies of \code{plotly = TRUE}}

\item{sppcol}{character vector of alternative colors to use for each species, must have length of six}
}
\value{
If \code{asreact = F}, a \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}} or \code{\link[plotly]{plotly}} (if \code{plotly = T}) object is returned showing trends over time by species for selected bay segments.  If \code{asreact = T}, a \code{\link[reactable]{reactable}} table showing results by year, segment, and species is returned.
}
\description{
Show annual averages of seagrass frequency occurrence by bay segments, year, and species
}
\details{
Results are based on averages across species by date and transect in each bay segment

\dontrun{
transect <- read_transect()

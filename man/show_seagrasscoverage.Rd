}
\details{
This function creates the flagship seagrass coverage graphic to report on coverage changes over time.  All data were pre-processed and included in the package as the \code{\link{seagrass}} dataset.  Original data are from the Southwest Florida Water Management District and available online at \link[https://data-swfwmd.opendata.arcgis.com/]{https://data-swfwmd.opendata.arcgis.com/}.  This function and the data used to create the plot are distinct from those used for the transect monitoring program.

    <p>The map shows average PEL ratios graded from A to F for benthic stations monitored in Tampa Bay. The PEL is a measure of how likely a contaminant is to have a toxic effect on invertebrates that inhabit the sediment. The PEL ratio is the contaminant concentration divided by the Potential Effects Levels (PEL) that applies to a contaminant, if available. Higher ratios and lower grades indicate sediment conditions that are likely unfavorable for invertebrates. The station average combines the PEL ratios across all contaminants measured at a station.</p>

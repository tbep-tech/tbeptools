#' The TB_Select_FIB_Catchments_Dissolved shapefile was compiled by
#' Ed Sherwood in April 2024 to delineate catchments for select
#' Enterococcus stations. This file is used to create the
#' catch_pixels data file, which associates each station with the radar pixels
#' over which we want to average precipitation to capture inputs to
#' that specific station.

<p>The Tampa Bay Benthic Index (TBBI) <span class="citation">[1,2]</span>) is an assessment method that quantifies
the ecological health of the benthic community in Tampa Bay. The index
provides a complementary approach to evaluating environmental condition
that is supported by other assessment methods currently available for
the region (e.g., water quality report card, nekton index, etc.). The
tbeptools package includes several functions described below to import
data required for the index and plot the results to view trends over
time. Each of the functions are described in detail below.</p>
<p>The TBBI uses data from the Tampa Bay Benthic Monitoring Program as
part of the Environmental Protection Commission (EPC) of Hillsborough
Country. The data are updated annually on a public site maintained by
EPC, typically in December after Summer/Fall sampling. This is the same
website that hosts water quality data used for the <a href="https://tbep-tech.github.io/tbeptools/articles/intro.html">water
quality report card</a>. The required data for the TBBI are more
extensive than the water quality report card and the data are made
available as a zipped folder of csv files, available <a href="https://epcbocc.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/Share/EtOJfziTTa9FliL1oROb9OsBRZU-nO60fu_0NRC162hHjQ?e=4gUXgJ" class="external-link">here</a>.
The process for downloading and working with the data are similar as for
the other functions in tbeptools.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="data-import-and-included-datasets">Data import and included datasets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-import-and-included-datasets"></a>
</h3>
<p>Data for calculating TBBI scores can be imported into the current R
session using the <code><a href="../reference/read_importbenthic.html">read_importbenthic()</a></code> function. This
function downloads the zipped folder of base tables used for the TBBI
from the EPC site if the data have not already been downloaded to the
location specified by the input arguments.</p>
<p>To download the data with tbeptools, first create a character path
for the location where you want to download the zipped files. If one
does not exist, specify a location and name for the downloaded file.
Here, we name the folder <code>benthic.zip</code> and download it on our
desktop.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">path</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="st">'~/Desktop/benthic.zip'</span></span>
<span><span class="va">benthicdata</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/read_importbenthic.html">read_importbenthic</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">path</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Running the above code will return the following error:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co">#&gt; Error in read_importbenthic() : File at path does not exist, use download_latest = TRUE</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We get an error message from the function indicating that the file is
not found. This makes sense because the file does not exist yet, so we
need to tell the function to download the latest file. This is done by
changing the <code>download_latest</code> argument to <code>TRUE</code>
(the default is <code>FALSE</code>).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">benthicdata</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/read_importbenthic.html">read_importbenthic</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">path</span>, download_latest <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">T</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co">#&gt; File ~/Desktop/benthic.zip does not exist, replacing with downloaded file...</span></span>
<span></span>

<p>Now we get an indication that the file on the server is being
downloaded. When the download is complete, we’ll have the data
downloaded and saved to the <code>benthicdata</code> object in the
current R session.</p>
<p>If we try to run the function again after downloading the data, we
get the following message. This check is done to make sure that the data
are not unnecessarily downloaded if the current file matches the file on
the server.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">benthicdata</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/read_importbenthic.html">read_importbenthic</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">path</span>, download_latest <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">T</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co">#&gt; File is current..</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Every time that tbeptools is used to work with the benthic data,
<code><a href="../reference/read_importbenthic.html">read_importbenthic()</a></code> should be used to import the data. You
will always receive the message <code>File is current...</code> if your
local file matches the one on the server. However, data are periodically
updated and posted on the server. If <code>download_latest = TRUE</code>
and your local file is out of date, you will receive the following
message:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co">#&gt; Replacing local file with current...</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">

</h3>
<p>After the data are imported, you can view them from the assigned
object. The data are provided as a nested tibble that includes three
different datasets: station information, field sample data (salinity),
and detailed taxa information.</p>

<p>The <code><a href="../reference/anlz_tbbiscr.html">anlz_tbbiscr()</a></code> function uses the nested
<code>benthicdata</code> to estimate the TBBI scores at each site. The
TBBI scores typically range from 0 to 100 and are grouped into
categories that describe the general condition of the benthic community.
Scores less than 73 are considered “degraded”, scores between 73 and 87
are “intermediate”, and scores greater than 87 are “healthy”. Locations
that were sampled but no organisms were found are assigned a score of
zero and a category of “empty sample”. The total abundance
(<code>TotalAbundance</code>, organisms/m2), species richness
(<code>SpeciesRichness</code>) and bottom salinity
(<code>Salinity</code>, psu) are also provided. Some metrics for the
TBBI are corrected for salinity and bottom measurements taken at the
time of sampling are required for accurate calculation of the TBBI.</p>

<p>The TBBI scores can be viewed as annual averages for each bay segment
using the <code><a href="../reference/show_tbbimatrix.html">show_tbbimatrix()</a></code> function. The
<code><a href="../reference/show_tbbimatrix.html">show_tbbimatrix()</a></code> plots the annual bay segment averages as
categorical values in a conventional “stoplight” graphic. A baywide
estimate is also returned, one based on all samples across all locations
(“All”) and another weighted by the relative surface areas of each bay
segment (“All (wt)”). The input to <code><a href="../reference/show_tbbimatrix.html">show_tbbimatrix()</a></code>
function is the output from the <code><a href="../reference/anlz_tbbiscr.html">anlz_tbbiscr()</a></code>
function.</p>

</h3>
<p>In addition to biological data, sediment contaminant concentrations
are measured at sites within Tampa Bay. These include over 100 different
constituents grouped broadly as metals, organics, physical, or other.
The concentrations of these constituents can be compared relative to
Threshold Effects Levels (TEL) or Potential Effects Levels (PEL), when
available, as relative indications of the likelihood that the
concentrations will have toxic effects on invertebrates that inhabit the
sediments. The functions in tbeptools can be used to retrieve the
sediment data and provide an indication of the concentrations relative
to the TEL or PEL thresholds.</p>
<p>The <code><a href="../reference/read_importsediment.html">read_importsediment()</a></code> function will retrieve all
sediment data for Tampa Bay collected annually by the Environmental
Protection Commission of Hillsborough County. The data are retrieved
from the <a href="https://epcbocc.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/Share/EtOJfziTTa9FliL1oROb9OsBRZU-nO60fu_0NRC162hHjQ?e=4gUXgJ" class="external-link">same

<p>The <code><a href="../reference/show_sedimentmap.html">show_sedimentmap()</a></code> function can be used to create
maps of selected parameters relative to TEL and PEL values. Green points
show concentrations below the TEL, yellow points show concentrations
between the TEL and PEL, and red points show concentrations above the
PEL. The applicable TEL and PEL values for the parameter are indicated
in the legend. The selected stations are those that are sampled in the
years within the <code>yrrng</code> argument.</p>

sediment quality
given the measured contaminants. The <code><a href="../reference/show_sedimentpelmap.html">show_sedimentpelmap()</a></code>
function creates a map of average PEL ratios graded from A to F for
benthic stations monitored in Tampa Bay. The PEL ratio is the
contaminant concentration divided by the Potential Effects Levels (PEL)
that applies to a contaminant, if available. Higher ratios and lower
grades indicate sediment conditions that are likely unfavorable for
invertebrates. The station average combines the PEL ratios across all
contaminants measured at a station.</p>

<p>The <code><a href="../reference/show_sedimentalratio.html">show_sedimentalratio()</a></code> function creates a plot of a
selected metal parameter against Aluminum. This plot provides
information on the concentration of the parameter relative to background
levels, where Aluminum is present as a common metal in the Earth’s
crust. An elevated ratio of a metal parameter relative to aluminum
suggests it is higher than background concentrations <span class="citation">[3]</span>. The linear fit of a log-log model is shown
as a solid black line, with 95% prediction intervals. The TEL/PEL
values, if available, are also shown as horizontal red lines.</p>

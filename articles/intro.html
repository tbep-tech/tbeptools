<p>Dashboard: <a href="https://shiny.tbep.org/wq-dash" class="external-link uri">https://shiny.tbep.org/wq-dash</a></p>
<p>This vignette provides an overview of the functions in tbeptools that
can be used to work with water quality data in Tampa Bay. View the other
vignettes for topical introductions to other reporting products (e.g.,
seagrasess, tidal creeks, etc.).</p>
<p>The environmental recovery of Tampa Bay is an exceptional success
story for coastal water quality management. Nitrogen loads in the mid
1970s have been estimated at 8.2 million kg/yr, with approximately 5.5
million kg/yr entering the upper Bay alone <span class="citation">[2]</span>. Reduced water clarity associated with
phytoplankton biomass contributed to a dramatic reduction in the areal
coverage of seagrass <span class="citation">[3]</span> and development
of hypoxic events, causing a decline in benthic faunal production <span class="citation">[4]</span>. Extensive efforts to reduce nutrient loads
to the Bay occurred by the late 1970s, with the most notable being
improvements in infrastructure for wastewater treatment in 1979.
Improvements in water clarity and decreases in chlorophyll
concentrations were observed Bay-wide in the 1980s, with conditions
generally remaining constant to present day <span class="citation">[5]</span>.</p>
<p>Tracking changes in environmental condition from the past to present
day would not have been possible without a long-term monitoring dataset.
Data have been collected monthly by the Environmental Protection
Commission of Hillsborough County since 1974 <span class="citation">[6,7]</span>. Samples are taken at forty-five stations
by water collection or monitoring sonde at bottom, mid- or surface
depths, depending on parameter. The locations of monitoring stations are
fixed and cover the entire Bay from the uppermost mesohaline sections to
the lowermost euhaline portions that have direct interaction with the
Gulf of Mexico. Up to 515 observations are available for different
parameters at each station, e.g., nitrogen, chlorophyll-a, and secchi
depth.</p>
<p>Data collected from the monitoring program are processed and
maintained in a spreadsheet titled
<code>RWMDataSpreadsheet_ThroughCurrentReportMonth.xlsx</code> at <a href="https://epcbocc.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Share/EWKgPirIkoxMp9Hm_wVEICsBk6avI9iSRjFiOxX58wXzIQ?e=kAWZXl&amp;download=1" class="external-link uri">https://epcbocc.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Share/EWKgPirIkoxMp9Hm_wVEICsBk6avI9iSRjFiOxX58wXzIQ?e=kAWZXl&amp;download=1</a>

These data include observations at all stations and for all parameters
throughout the period of record. To date, there have been no systematic
tools for importing, analyzing, and reporting information from these
data. The <strong>tbeptools</strong> package provides was developed to
address this need.</p>

</h3>
<p>The main function for importing water quality data is
<code><a href="../reference/read_importwq.html">read_importwq()</a></code>. This function downloads the latest file if
one is not already available at the location specified by the
<code>xlsx</code> input argument.</p>
<p>First, create a character path for the location of the file. If one
does not exist, specify a desired location and name for the downloaded
file. Here, we want to put the file in the vignettes folder and name is
current_results.xls. Note that this file path is relative to the root
working directly for the current R session. You can view the working
directory with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/getwd.html" class="external-link">getwd()</a></code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">xlsx</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="st">'vignettes/current_results.xlsx'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we pass this <code>xlsx</code> object to the
<code><a href="../reference/read_importwq.html">read_importwq()</a></code> function.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">epcdata</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/read_importwq.html">read_importwq</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">xlsx</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We get an error message from the function indicating that the file is
not found. This makes sense because the file doesn’t exist yet, so we
need to tell the function to download the latest file. This is done by
changing the <code>download_latest</code> argument to <code>TRUE</code>
(the default is <code>FALSE</code>).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">epcdata</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/read_importwq.html">read_importwq</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">xlsx</span>, download_latest <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>#&gt; File vignettes/current_results.xlsx does not exist, replacing with downloaded file...

#&gt; trying URL 'https://epcbocc.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Share/EYXZ5t16UlFGk1rzIU91VogBa8U37lh8z_Hftf2KJISSHg?e=8r1SUL&amp;download=1'
 length 24562051 bytes (23.4 MB)</code></pre>
<p>Now we get the same message, but with an indication that the file on
the server is being downloaded. We’ll have the data downloaded and saved
to the <code>epcdata</code> object after it finishes downloading.</p>
<p>If we try to run the function again after downloading the data from
the server, we get the following message. This check is done to make
sure that the data are not unnecessarily downloaded if the current file
matches the file on the server.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">epcdata</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/read_importwq.html">read_importwq</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">xlsx</span>, download_latest <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code><span><span class="co">#&gt; File is current...</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Every time that tbeptools is used to work with the monitoring data,
<code><a href="../reference/read_importwq.html">read_importwq()</a></code> should be used to import the data. You will
always receive the message <code>File is current...</code> if your local
file matches the one on the server. However, new data are regularly
collected and posted on the server. If
<code>download_latest = TRUE</code> and your local file is out of date,
you will receive the following message:</p>
<pre><code><span><span class="co">#&gt; Replacing local file with current...</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The argument <code>na</code> indicates which fields in the downloaded
spreadsheet are treated as blank values and assigned to <code>NA</code>.
Any number of strings can be added to this function to replace fields
with <code>NA</code> values.</p>
<p>After the data are successfully imported, you can view them from the
assigned object:</p>

<p>These data include the bay segment name, station number, sample time,
year, month, latitude, longitude, station depth, sample depth, total
nitrogen, secchi depth, chlorophyll, salinity, water temperature,
turbidity, and water color. All other parameters can be included by
setting <code>all = TRUE</code> in <code><a href="../reference/read_importwq.html">read_importwq()</a></code>.</p>
<p>An import function is also available to download and format
phytoplankton cell count data. The <code><a href="../reference/read_importphyto.html">read_importphyto()</a></code>
function works similarly as the import function for the water quality
data. Start by specifying a path where the data should be downloaded and
set <code>download_latest</code> to <code>TRUE</code>. This function
will download and summarize data from the file
<code>PlanktonDataList_ThroughCurrentReportMonth.xlsx</code> on the EPC
website.</p>

<p>These data are highly summarized from the raw data file available
online. Cell counts (as number of cells per 0.1mL) for selected taxa are
summed for each station by quarters (i.e., Jan/Feb/Mar, Apr/May/Jun,
etc.). The quarter is indicated in the <code>yrqrt</code> column
specified by the starting date of each quarter (e.g.,
<code>1975-07-01</code> is the quarter Jul/Aug/Sep for 1975). These data
are primarily used to support analyses in the water quality dashboard:

<p>Most of the water quality functions in tbeptools were developed to
work with the long-term monitoring data from the Environmental
Protection Commission of Hillsborough County. Additional monitoring
programs in Tampa Bay can also be used to develop a more complete
description of water quality.</p>
<p>The <code>import_readwqp()</code> function can be used to retrieve
data from the USEPA Water Quality Portal for monitoring data from
Pinellas and Manatee County. The function retrieves nutrient,
chlorophyll, and secchi data for all available estuarine stations
monitored by each county. The data can be retrieved as follows and will
typically take less than one minute to download.</p>

<p>The functions <code><a href="../reference/anlz_avedat.html">anlz_avedat()</a></code> and
<code><a href="../reference/anlz_avedatsite.html">anlz_avedatsite()</a></code> summarize the station data by bay
segments or by sites, respectively. Both functions return annual means
for chlorophyll and light attenuation (based on Secchi depth
measurements) and monthly means by year for chlorophyll and light
attenuation. These summaries are then used to determine if bay segment
targets for water quality are met using the <code><a href="../reference/anlz_attain.html">anlz_attain()</a></code>
and <code><a href="../reference/anlz_attainsite.html">anlz_attainsite()</a></code> function.</p>
<p>Here we use <code><a href="../reference/anlz_avedat.html">anlz_avedat()</a></code> to summarize the data by bay
segment to estimate annual and monthly means for chlorophyll and light
attenuation. The output is a two-element list for the annual
(<code>ann</code>) and monthly (<code>mos</code>) means by segment.</p>

<p>This output can then be further analyzed with
<code><a href="../reference/anlz_attain.html">anlz_attain()</a></code> to determine if the bay segment outcomes are
met in each year. The results are used by the plotting functions
described below. In short, the <code>chl_la</code> column indicates the
categorical outcome for chlorophyll and light attenuation for each
segment. The outcomes are integer values from zero to three. The
relative exceedances of water quality thresholds for each segment, both
in duration and magnitude, are indicated by higher integer values.</p>

<p>The <code><a href="../reference/show_thrplot.html">show_thrplot()</a></code> function provides a more descriptive
assessment of annual trends for a chosen bay segment relative to defined
targets or thresholds. In this plot we show the annual averages across
stations Old Tampa bay (<code>bay_segment = "OTB"</code>) for
chlorophyll (<code>thr = "chla"</code>). The red line shows annual
trends and the horizontal blue lines indicate the thresholds and targets
for chlorophyll-a that are specific to Old Tampa Bay. The dashed and
dotted blue lines indicate +1 and +2 standard errors for the management
target shown by the filled line. The target and standard errors are
considered when identifying the annual segment outcome for
chlorophyll.</p>

<p>Similarly, the <code><a href="../reference/show_boxplot.html">show_boxplot()</a></code> function provides an
assessment of seasonal changes in chlorophyll or light attenuation
values by bay segment. The most recent year is highlighted in red by
default. This allows a simple evaluation of how the most recent year
compared to historical averages. The large exceedance value is shown in
blue text and as the dotted line. This corresponds to a “large”
magnitude change of +2 standard errors above the bay segment threshold
and is the same dotted line shown in <code><a href="../reference/show_thrplot.html">show_thrplot()</a></code>.</p>

<p>The <code><a href="../reference/show_thrplot.html">show_thrplot()</a></code> function is useful to understand
annual variation in chlorophyll and light attenuation relative to
management targets for each bay segment. The information from these
plots can provide an understanding of how the annual reporting outcomes
are determined. As noted above, an outcome integer from zero to three is
assigned to each bay segment for each annual estimate of chlorophyll and
light attenuation. These outcomes are based on both the exceedance of
the annual estimate above the threshold or target (blue lines in
<code><a href="../reference/show_thrplot.html">show_thrplot()</a></code>) and duration of the exceedance for the
years prior. The following graphic describes this logic <span class="citation">[8]</span>.</p>

Outcomes for annual estimates of water quality are assigned an integer
value from zero to three depending on both magnitude and duration of the
exceedence.
</p>
</div>
<p>These outcomes are assigned for both chlorophyll and light
attenuation. The duration criteria are determined based on whether the
exceedance was observed for years prior to the current year. The
exceedance criteria for chlorophyll and light-attenuation are specific
to each segment. The tbeptools package contains a <code>targets</code>
data file that is a reference for determining annual outcomes. This file
is loaded automatically with the package and can be viewed from the
command line.</p>

<p>The <code><a href="../reference/show_sitemap.html">show_sitemap()</a></code> function also includes an argument to
specify a particular monthly range for the selected year. If this option
is chosen, averages are shown as continuous values at each station.</p>

<p>Bay segment exceedances can also be viewed in a matrix using
<code><a href="../reference/show_wqmatrix.html">show_wqmatrix()</a></code>. The thresholds for these values correspond
to the Florida DEP criteria (or a large exceedance defined as +2
standard errors above the segment target).</p>

<p>By default, the <code><a href="../reference/show_wqmatrix.html">show_wqmatrix()</a></code> function returns
chlorophyll exceedances by segment. Light attenuation exceedances can be
viewed by changing the <code>param</code> argument.</p>

<p>The results from <code><a href="../reference/show_matrix.html">show_matrix()</a></code> and
<code><a href="../reference/show_wqmatrix.html">show_wqmatrix()</a></code> can be combined for an individual segment
using the <code><a href="../reference/show_segmatrix.html">show_segmatrix()</a></code> function. This is useful to
understand which water quality parameter is driving the management
outcome for a given year. The plot shows the light attenuation and
chlorophyll outcomes from <code><a href="../reference/show_wqmatrix.html">show_wqmatrix()</a></code> next to the
segment management outcomes from <code><a href="../reference/show_matrix.html">show_matrix()</a></code>. Only one
segment can be plotted for each function call.</p>

<p>Finally, all segment plots can be shown together using the
<code><a href="../reference/show_segplotly.html">show_segplotly()</a></code> function that combines chlorophyll and
secchi data for a given segment. This function combines outputs from
<code><a href="../reference/show_thrplot.html">show_thrplot()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/show_segmatrix.html">show_segmatrix()</a></code>. The final
plot is interactive and can be zoomed by dragging the mouse pointer over
a section of the plot. Information about each cell or value can be seen
by hovering over a location in the plot.</p>

history of water quality in Tampa Bay. Degraded conditions were common
early in the period of record, particularly for Old Tampa Bay and
Hillsborough Bay. Conditions began to improve by the late 1980s and
early 1990s, with good conditions persisting to present day. However,
recent trends in Old Tampa Bay have shown conditions changing from “stay
the course” to “caution”.</p>

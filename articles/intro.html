<p>The environmental recovery of Tampa Bay is an exceptional success story for coastal water quality management. Nitrogen loads in the mid 1970s have been estimated at 8.2 million kg/yr, with approximately 5.5 million kg/yr entering the upper Bay alone <span class="citation">[1]</span>. Reduced water clarity associated with phytoplankton biomass contributed to a dramatic reduction in the areal coverage of seagrass <span class="citation">[3]</span> and development of hypoxic events, causing a decline in benthic faunal production <span class="citation">[4]</span>. Extensive efforts to reduce nutrient loads to the Bay occurred by the late 1970s, with the most notable being improvements in infrastructure for wastewater treatment in 1979. Improvements in water clarity and decreases in chlorophyll concentrations were observed Bay-wide in the 1980s, with conditions generally remaining constant to present day <span class="citation">[5]</span>.</p>
<p>Tracking changes in environmental condition from the past to present day would not have been possible without a long-term monitoring dataset. Data have been collected monthly by the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County since 1974 <span class="citation">[6,7]</span>. Samples are taken at forty-five stations using by water collection or monitoring sonde at bottom, mid- or surface depths, depending on parameter. The locations of monitoring stations are fixed and cover the entire Bay from the uppermost mesohaline sections to the lowermost euhaline portions that have direct interaction with the Gulf of Mexico. Up to 515 observations are available for different parameters at each station, e.g., nitrogen, chlorophyll-a, and secchi depth.</p>

<a href="#package-goal" class="anchor"></a>Package goal</h2>
<p>Data collected from the monitoring program are processed and maintained in a spreadsheet titled <code>RWMDataSpreadsheet_ThroughCurrentReportMonth.xlsx</code> at <a href="ftp://ftp.epchc.org/EPC_ERM_FTP/WQM_Reports/" class="uri">ftp://ftp.epchc.org/EPC_ERM_FTP/WQM_Reports/</a>. These data include observations at all stations and for all parameters throughout the period of record. To date, there have been no systematic tools for importing, analyzing, and reporting information from these data. The <strong>tbeptools</strong> package provides was developed to address this need.</p>
<p>Functions in tbeptools fall in three categories depending on mode of use. Each function is named using a prefix for the mode of use, followed by what the function does. The prefixes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>read</code>: Import current data from the main ftp site.</p></li>
<li><p><code>anlz</code>: Analyze or summarize the imported data.</p></li>
<li><p><code>show</code>: Create a plot of the analyzed data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following shows all functions provided in tbeptools, organized by prefix.</p>

<p>The functions can be easily found in RStudio after loading the package and typing the prefix at the command line. An autofill dialog box will pop up showing all functions that apply for the prefix. This eliminates the need for searching for individual functions if all you know is the category of function you need (e.g., <code>read</code>, <code>anlz</code>, or <code>show</code>). For example:</p>

<a href="#installing-tbeptools" class="anchor"></a>Installing tbeptools</h2>
<p>Begin by installing the package from GitHub. The source code is available on the tbep-tech GitHub group web page: <a href="https://github.com/tbep-tech/tbeptools" class="uri">https://github.com/tbep-tech/tbeptools</a>.</p>
<p>First, install the devtools package, load devtools, then install and load tbeptools. Note that tbeptools only needs to be installed once, but it needs to be loaded every new R session (i.e., <code><a href="https://github.com/tbep-tech/tbeptools">library(tbeptools)</a></code>).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html">install.packages</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">'devtools'</span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">devtools</span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="fu">install_github</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">'tbep-tech/tbeptools'</span><span class="op">)</span>

<p>After the package is loaded, you can view the help files for each function by typing a question mark followed by the function name, e.g., <code><a href="../reference/read_importwq.html">?read_importwq</a></code>, on the console. The help files provide a brief description of what each function does and the required arguments that are needed to run the function.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="helpfileex.png" alt="The help file for `read_importwq`." width="70%"><p class="caption">
The help file for <code>read_importwq</code>.
</p>
</div>
<p>In the above example, the <code><a href="../reference/read_importwq.html">read_importwq()</a></code> functions accepts six arguments. All but one argument have default values that change the behavior of the function. In most cases, the default values are appropriate. The only required argument is <code>xlsx</code> that specifies a path where a local excel file is located. The details of this function are described below.</p>
</div>
<div id="read-1" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#read-1" class="anchor"></a>Read</h2>
<p>There are 12 functions in tbeptools for reading or importing data from the main ftp website listed above:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code><a href="../reference/read_chkdate.html">read_chkdate()</a></code>: Compare date of local xlsx file with the same file on the server</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="../reference/read_dlcurrent.html">read_dlcurrent()</a></code>: Download latest file from epchc.org</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="../reference/read_formbenthic.html">read_formbenthic()</a></code>: Format benthic data for the Tampa Bay Benthic Index</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="../reference/read_formfim.html">read_formfim()</a></code>: Format FIM data for the Tampa Bay Nekton Index</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="../reference/read_formphyto.html">read_formphyto()</a></code>: Format phytoplankton data</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="../reference/read_formtransect.html">read_formtransect()</a></code>: Format seagrass transect data from Water Atlas</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="../reference/read_formwq.html">read_formwq()</a></code>: Format water quality data</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="../reference/read_importbenthic.html">read_importbenthic()</a></code>: Download and import benthic data for Tampa Bay</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="../reference/read_importfim.html">read_importfim()</a></code>: Load local FIM data for the Tampa Bay Nekton Index</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="../reference/read_importphyto.html">read_importphyto()</a></code>: Load local phytoplankton cell count file</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="../reference/read_importwq.html">read_importwq()</a></code>: Load local water quality file</p></li>
<li><p><code><a href="../reference/read_transect.html">read_transect()</a></code>: Import JSON seagrass transect data from Water Atlas</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The main function for importing water quality data is <code><a href="../reference/read_importwq.html">read_importwq()</a></code>. This function downloads the latest file if one is not already available at the location specified by the <code>xlsx</code> input argument.</p>
<p>First, create a character path for the location of the file. If one does not exist, specify a desired location and name for the downloaded file. Here, we want to put the file in the vignettes folder and name is 2018_Results_updated.xls. Note that this file path is relative to the root working directly for the current R session. You can view the working directory with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/getwd.html">getwd()</a></code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">xlsx</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="st">'vignettes/2018_Results_updated.xls'</span></code></pre></div>

<p>We get an error message from the function indicating that the file is not found. This makes sense because the file doesn’t exist yet, so we need to tell the function to download the latest file.

<p>These data are highly summarized from the raw data file available online. Cell counts (as number of cells per 0.1mL) for selected taxa are summed for each station by quarters (i.e., Jan/Feb/Mar, Apr/May/Jun, etc.). The quarter is indicated in the <code>yrqrt</code> column specified by the starting date of each quarter (e.g., <code>1975-07-01</code> is the quarter Jul/Aug/Sep for 1975).

<p>The <code><a href="../reference/show_thrplot.html">show_thrplot()</a></code> function provides a more descriptive assessment of annual trends for a chosen bay segment relative to defined targets or thresholds. In this plot we show the annual averages across stations Old Tampa bay (<code>bay_segment = "OTB"</code>) for chlorophyll (<code>thr = "chla"</code>). The red line shows annual trends and the horizontal blue lines indicate the thresholds and targets for chlorophyll-a that are specific to Old Tampa Bay. The dashed and dotted blue lines indicate +1 and +2 standard errors for the management target shown by the filled line. The target and standard errors are considered when identifying the annual segment outcome for chlorophyll.</p>

<p>Similarly, the <code><a href="../reference/show_boxplot.html">show_boxplot()</a></code> function provides an assessment of seasonal changes in chlorophyll or light attenuation values by bay segment. The most recent year is highlighted in red by default. This allows a simple evaluation of how the most recent year compared to historical averages. The large exceedance value is shown in blue text and as the dotted line. This corresponds to a “large” magnitude change of +2 standard errors above the bay segment threshold and is the same dotted line shown in <code><a href="../reference/show_thrplot.html">show_thrplot()</a></code>.</p>

<p>The <code><a href="../reference/show_thrplot.html">show_thrplot()</a></code> function is useful to understand annual variation in chlorophyll and light attenuation relative to management targets for each bay segment. The information from these plots can provide an understanding of how the annual reporting outcomes are determined. As noted above, an outcome integer from zero to three is assigned to each bay segment for each annual estimate of chlorophyll and light attenuation. These outcomes are based on both the exceedance of the annual estimate above the threshold or target (blue lines in <code><a href="../reference/show_thrplot.html">show_thrplot()</a></code>) and duration of the exceedance for the years prior. The following graphic describes this logic <span class="citation">[8]</span>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="outints.PNG" alt="Outcomes for annual estimates of water quality are assigned an integer value from zero to three depending on both magnitude and duration of the exceedence." width="80%"><p class="caption">
Outcomes for annual estimates of water quality are assigned an integer value from zero to three depending on both magnitude and duration of the exceedence.
</p>
</div>
<p>These outcomes are assigned for both chlorophyll and light attenuation. The duration criteria are determined based on whether the exceedance was observed for years prior to the current year. The exceedance criteria for chlorophyll and light-attenuation are specific to each segment. The tbeptools package contains a <code>targets</code> data file that is a reference for determining annual outcomes. This file is loaded automatically with the package and can be viewed from the command line.</p>

<p>The final plotting function is <code><a href="../reference/show_matrix.html">show_matrix()</a></code>, which creates an annual reporting matrix that reflects the combined outcomes for chlorophyll and light attenuation. Tracking the attainment of bay segment specific targets for these indicators provides the framework from which bay management actions are developed and initiated. For each year and segment, a color-coded management action is assigned:</p>
<p><span style="color:#33FF3B; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #333;"><strong>Stay the Course</strong></span>: Continue planned projects. Report data via annual progress reports and Baywide Environmental Monitoring Report.</p>
<p><span style="color:#F9FF33; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #333;"><strong>Caution</strong></span>: Review monitoring data and nitrogen loading estimates. Begin/continue TAC and Management Board development of specific management recommendations.</p>
<p><span style="color:#FF3333; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #333;"><strong>On Alert</strong></span>: Finalize development and implement appropriate management actions to get back on track.</p>

<p>The results from <code><a href="../reference/show_matrix.html">show_matrix()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/show_wqmatrix.html">show_wqmatrix()</a></code> can be combined for an individual segment using the <code><a href="../reference/show_segmatrix.html">show_segmatrix()</a></code> function. This is useful to understand which water quality parameter is driving the management outcome for a given year. The plot shows the light attenuation and chlorophyll outcomes from <code><a href="../reference/show_wqmatrix.html">show_wqmatrix()</a></code> next to the segment management outcomes from <code><a href="../reference/show_matrix.html">show_matrix()</a></code>. Only one segment can be plotted for each function call.</p>

<p>Finally, all segment plots can be shown together using the <code><a href="../reference/show_segplotly.html">show_segplotly()</a></code> function that combines chlorophyll and secchi data for a given segment. This function combines outputs from <code><a href="../reference/show_thrplot.html">show_thrplot()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/show_segmatrix.html">show_segmatrix()</a></code>. The final plot is interactive and can be zoomed by dragging the mouse pointer over a section of the plot. Information about each cell or value can be seen by hovering over a location in the plot. Please note that the scaling here is horrible, but this can be changed when creating the plot on your own.</p>

Degraded conditions were common early in the period of record, particularly for Old Tampa Bay and Hillsborough Bay. Conditions began to improve by the late 1980s and early 1990s, with good conditions persisting to present day. However, recent trends in Old Tampa Bay have shown conditions changing from “stay the course” to “caution”.</p>
